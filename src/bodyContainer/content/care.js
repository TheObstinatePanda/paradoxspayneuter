            <h3 className='opins'>POST-OP Instructions</h3>
            <p>1. If your animal is 6 months of age or younger they will need to eat the night of surgery. If your animal is over 6 months of age only give CLEAR liquids for 24 hrs after surgery. If your pet will not eat, try giving them table syrup.</p>
            <p>2. Most animal's incisions will be glued as there is NO suture removal required. Make sure to keep this area DRY. If you notice your pet licking or pulling at the incision area, a restraint collar will be required to prevent infection, these can be bought at any pet store. If we had to use sutures during operation, they must be removed 10 days after the procedure date. You can do this yourself with small clippers or, if you have problems, you may call to schedule a time to bring your pet in for suture removal at no charge.</p>
            <p>3. Do NOT give your animal Tylenol or any other over the counter pain relief. These are not formulated for animals and can be toxic to your pets. We will provide pain medication.</p>
            <p>4. Restrict jumping and extensive amounts of exercise for 10 days after surgery.</p>
            <p>5. If your pet was in-heat when spayed, keep it away from all male animals for 10 days! This is to prevent attempted breeding which could cause internal bleeding which may result in death of your pet.</p>
